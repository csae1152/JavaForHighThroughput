Operating systems: Networking stack

There are countless books, videos, and tutorials for the tuning the Linux networking stack. 
And sadly tons of “sysctl.conf cargo-culting” that comes with them. 
Even though recent kernel versions do not require as much tuning as they used 
to 10 years ago and most of the new TCP/IP features are enabled and well-tuned by default, people are still 
copy-pasting their old sysctls.conf that they’ve used to tune 2.6.18/2.6.32 kernels.
